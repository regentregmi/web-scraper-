# web-scraper

A web scraper is a software tool or program designed to automatically extract data from websites.
Instead of manually copying and pasting information from web pages, a web scraper visits web pages, reads the page content (usually the HTML code), and pulls out specific pieces of data you want like text, images, links, prices, or any other visible info.
